# VideoCall-Audio-Video-Stream-Socket.io
For making a video call app, It is required that each and every client send their video and audio stream to all the other clients.
So for this purpose  i used Peer.js and for the communication between the clients and the server we are using WebSocket i.e. Socket.io.

to take users audio, video streams and send that stream to another client. For this, i used  WebRTC here.
